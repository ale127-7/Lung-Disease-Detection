# Lung Cancer Detection

Model made with a Jetson-Nano to be able to give percentages and to tell the types different lung cancers based on images.


## The Algorithm

For my project I used image recognition so the AI can be able to determine the different types of lung cancers and gives percentages based off of the picture.
## Running this project

1. Set up your Jetson-Nano
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Download your Data Set
4. Change Directories by putting in ''
